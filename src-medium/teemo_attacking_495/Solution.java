package teemo_attacking_495;

//	In LOL world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his enemy Ashe be in poisoned condition. 
//	Now, given the Teemo's attacking ascending time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, 
//	you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.
//	
//	You may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, 
//	and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.

//	Note:
//		You may assume the length of given time series array won't exceed 10000.
//		You may assume the numbers in the Teemo's attacking time series
//		and his poisoning time duration per attacking are non-negative integers, which won't exceed 10,000,000.
