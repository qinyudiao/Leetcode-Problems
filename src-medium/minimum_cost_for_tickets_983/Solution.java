package minimum_cost_for_tickets_983;

//	In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance. 
//	The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array days.  Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.
//	
//	Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:
//		a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars;
//		a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars;
//		a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.
//		
//	The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.  For example, 
//	if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
//	
//	Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.

//	Note:
//		1 <= days.length <= 365
//		1 <= days[i] <= 365
//		days is in strictly increasing order.
//		costs.length == 3
//		1 <= costs[i] <= 1000
